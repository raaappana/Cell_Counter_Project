# Cell_Counter_Project
A python/batch program that interfaces with IBM WATSON and Cell Profiler to count malaria infected blood cells.

I started this program three years ago, but didn't seriously follow up on it until within the past few months. Because of this, I've decided to be conservative in what's posted as I still have to organize the chicken scratch that is my old code.
